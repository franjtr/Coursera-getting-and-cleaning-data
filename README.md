3 Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.<br />
4 Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.<br />
5 Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.<br />
6 Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.<br />
7 Creates a independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity.<br />
<br />
You can find additional information about the data in the CodeBook.MD file.
